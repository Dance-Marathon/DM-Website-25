We have newly promoted members lending their skills and talents to the team, helping over the summer to plan for the year ahead.

As DM recruitment week begins, we encourage you to explore what is important to you. Whether this is your first time hearing about our cause, or you first got involved as a Miracle Maker, Captain, Emerging Leader, or Ambassador, you have found a home in Dance Marathon.",
      "This organization isn't just a philanthropy, but a family. One of our 2025 Assistant Directors, Maya Vaidya, shared her experience with her Dance Marathon family. Coming from out of state, Maya was unsure of what she wanted to get involved in, but she wanted to “be a part of something bigger” than herself. She first heard about DM through a conversation with a friend and eventually found the Emerging Leaders Program before becoming a Captain. Maya remembered, “Everyone was talking about DM and how it's changed their life,” and she had to be a part of it. “I heard about it, I applied, I interviewed, and then I fell in love,” she explained.",
      "She quickly realized that the Emerging Leader Program combined leadership with undertones of philanthropy - two of her passions. The program allowed her to be in a cohort with around 20 other people and four Captains guiding her through the process. She recalled, “A month in, I had 20 new best friends. I felt like I had met my platonic soulmates.”",
      "A year later, Maya returned to DM as a Leadership Development Captain. She explained, “I wanted my ELP's to fall in love with DM as much as I did.” She wanted to be the role model that her Leadership Development Captains were to her, and was successful at that. “The way that the ELP Captains are able to orchestrate this community between 20 strangers is just so cool,” Maya said.",
      "Going from a Freshman that had no idea what DM was or how much it would impact her life, Maya found her family in the Emerging Leader Program. She said, “You come out of it knowing you had a hand in doing something special. It's so special to have that connection and see everyone blossom.” This experience is something formative for so many future Captains, and our community is excited to see the next generation of ELP's this year.",
      "We encourage you, whether you're unsure about DM or the plethora of organizations that UF has to offer, to take a step back and consider the Emerging Leader Program. A group of 20 strangers may soon become your best friends, your family, future captains, and change makers.",

It serves as a reminder that each Children’s Miracle Network Hospital is working together for the next generation. “Getting to connect with other schools who fight for our same cause means so much,” Rylie explained, “it all goes back to the Miracle Kids we love.”",

      "Let’s face it, walking through Turlington is every UF student’s worst nightmare. No matter which corner you turn, you are met with an overwhelming amount of clubs, organizations, and events encouraging your participation. After a long day at class, you stare at the pile of flyers you collected along the way and consider your valuable free time wondering, “Which organization should I take a chance on?”",
      "What if I told you that in just a few minutes, you could be part of something bigger than yourself? That’s exactly what Dance Marathon at the University of Florida is all about—giving you the chance to become a Miracle Maker and create a lasting impact on the lives of children at UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital.",
      "As a Miracle Maker, you will have the opportunity to make a difference for the patients and families impacted by childhood illness at UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital. Through fundraising, hearing stories from Miracle Families, interacting with other members, and participating in the Main Event, being a Miracle Maker is truly life-changing.",
      "Taking on the role of a Miracle Maker has left lasting impacts on thousands of students at UF. Ava Orlando, the Overall Director of Recruitment for DM at UF, started her journey as a Miracle Maker. “It was the best decision I have made so far in my collegiate career,” said Orlando, “and I couldn’t imagine not furthering my commitment to this organization.”",
      "Every dollar raised, every step taken, and every story shared through DM at UF is a testament to the power of saying “yes” to a cause worth fighting for; a story in need of writing; a miracle waiting to happen.",
      "Whether you’ve been involved with Dance Marathon before or you’re just learning about it, now is the perfect time to get involved and fight for a cause that changes lives. Register as a Miracle Maker today, and watch as you help write the next chapters of each child battling pediatric illness.",
      "If you were to take a chance on anything, take a chance on being a Miracle Maker.",

When your child or sibling is sick, hearing them laugh feels like a beacon of hope, a reminder that joy can still exist even in the darkest moments. It’s those small, precious laughs that remind us of what we’re fighting for: a world where every kid gets to simply be a kid.",
      "This February, Dance Marathon at the University of Florida is focusing on the heart of our mission—to bring more laughter, more hope, and more light into the lives of families facing pediatric illness. Each of our members is dedicated to raising $300 this month, symbolizing the 300 times the average child laughs each day.",
      "People always say that laughter is the best medicine, and it can truly be life-saving. Laughter is proven to reduce stress and boost immunity. DM at UF is committed to raising funds that lead to more laughter—through the Child Life program, Arts in Medicine, and renovated playrooms.",
      "These initiatives make a child’s hospital stay just a little brighter. They allow kids to take their minds off of doctors and machines, and focus on their childhood—on singing along to their favorite song during music therapy, on making a new friend in a freshly renovated playroom, on laughing while painting their own masterpiece. These moments of joy may seem small, but to a family facing pediatric illness, they mean everything.",
      "This February, we are fighting for more of those moments. More smiles lighting up playgrounds. More belly laughs echoing through homes. More chances for kids to feel like kids. By donating, sharing, and fundraising, you are bringing light to families who need it most. Join us as we turn laughter into healing, hope into action, and dollars into miracles.",

We work to make sure that these kids are the ones who come back 10 years from now to see the organization that helped save their lives.",

We finish the homework so we can make one more phone call for a donation. We pass the exams so we can talk to our classmates about joining our cause. We keep pushing Beyond Tomorrow so our Miracle Families never have to spend their tomorrow in a hospital room.",

      "For Olivia, our Finance Manager, one word that captures her Dance Marathon at UF experience is spark. It’s the word that describes how her involvement in our organization began, how it grew and how it has shaped her college experience and her future. Olivia first heard about Dance Marathon at the University of Florida during her freshman year while going through UF Panhellenic Recruitment. At the time, she was on the Pre-Med track, and almost every person she met told her how impactful DM at UF was, especially with its mission to support Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, like UF Health Shands Children's Hospital. After hearing how perfectly our mission aligned with her dreams of helping others, a spark was lit.",
      "Her involvement began as an Emerging Leader in Unit 44, where she discovered something special within our organization—one that was built on creativity, collaboration and purpose. As a sophomore and junior, she served as a Merchandise Captain, bringing ideas to life and transforming them into tangible symbols of the movement she loved. For her senior year, she was given the life-changing opportunity to serve as the Overall Director of the Merchandise Team. Olivia led her team with passion and dedication, and right after revealing the yearlong total at the Main Event, she remembers finding her team and seeing how much joy and pride they had on their faces. It was, in every sense, a “right reason” moment.",
      "As her time as an Overall Director came to a close, Olivia was not ready to leave DM at UF behind. After being accepted into graduate school at UF, she knew she was able to continue to give back to the organization that had given her so much. Now, as Finance Manager, she’s continuing to share her passion for this organization. Along the way, she has grown into the leader she is today because of DM at UF; she leads with empathy, approaches challenges with creativity and commits herself wholeheartedly to something bigger than herself.",
      "What began as a spark freshman year has grown into a clearer vision for her future: Olivia wants to pursue nonprofit management and one day work for Children’s Miracle Network, helping other Dance Marathon programs succeed.",
      "If you are unsure about joining Dance Marathon at the University of Florida, “Just do it.” The friendships, skills and memories you create are unlike any other. For Olivia, DM at UF started off as a spark that has defined her time at UF and will continue to guide her far beyond.",

      "Last year, 15,000 kids were diagnosed with cancer in the United States. Although pediatric cancers are one of the leading causes of death in this country, childhood cancer research is consistently underfunded. September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, and DM at UF is committed to honoring those currently fighting against their disease, those who lost their battle too soon and the loved ones who stand alongside them.",
      "UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital is ranked among the top 50 hospitals for pediatric cancer programs nationwide, according to the 2024-2025 U.S. News & World Report Rankings. While many families travel great distances to access the life saving care it provides, we are fortunate to have such an incredible resource just minutes from campus. Every dollar raised by Dance Marathon at UF supports Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, funding pediatric research and meeting hospitals’ areas of greatest need. A significant portion of these funds also supports Child Life initiatives, Arts in Medicine and other non-billable services that give children comfort and a sense of normalcy during treatment. These programs create opportunities for joy through laughter, music and playing, especially on days that are otherwise filled with doctors and medicine. What may seem like simple activities can have a profound impact. They lift children’s spirits, strengthen their quality of life and bring hope to families during their most difficult moments.",
      "The Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, Unit 42, was renovated using Children’s Miracle Network funding. Thanks to advances in treatment and technology across the country, about 85% of children diagnosed with cancer are now alive five years after their diagnosis. This is a remarkable improvement from the 1970s, when the five-year survival rate was as low as 58%.",
      "This month, take time to help those who need it most. #TogetherWe will fight for a future filled with miracles and milestones because every child deserves the chance to thrive. Whether big or small, every gesture can make an impact beyond imagination.",
