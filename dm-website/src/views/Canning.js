          How to do it?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary" paragraph>
          First, obtain specially designed canning buckets from our Partnerships
          Team (contact{" "}
          <Link href="mailto:jranson@floridadm.org">jranson@floridadm.org</Link>{" "}
          for further information). Email, call, or go inside a local business
          in your hometown and request to speak to the General Manager regarding
          canning donations. They will inform you of all the necessary
          regulations, and allow you to coordinate a time that works for both
          you and the business.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary" paragraph>
          Be sure to show up promptly and dressed in Dance Marathon at UF attire
          to help spread your message! From there, talk to customers as they
          leave the business about donating to your cause. No donation is too
          small and every amount helps make miracles!
